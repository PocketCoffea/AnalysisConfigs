# eft_weights_oldv.py
Old version to get the reweighted simulation.

# eft_weights.py
New version to get the reweighted simulation, with this you can reweight all over wilson space.




# worklow.py
workflow for SMEFT starting point events.

# worklow_SMc.py
workflow for SM starting point events.




# custom_cuts.py
cuts on lepton pt and eta, and on jets pt and eta. 


# config_EFTc_v1.py
Old version, analysis of both variables and weights for SMEFT starting point simulation, only reweighted where WCs are set to 5 and 10 and manual selection of reweighted simulation using eft_weights_oldv.py. 

# config_EFTc_v2.py
New version, analysis of both variables and weights for SMEFT starting point simulation, reweighted all over Wilson space using eft_weights.py.

# config_EFTc_v2_onlyvar.py 
New version, analysis of only variables for SMEFT starting point simulation, reweighted all over Wilson space using eft_weights.py.

# config_EFTc_v2_onlyXS.py
New version, analysis of only the XS for SMEFT starting point simulation, reweighted all over Wilson space using eft_weights.py.

# config_SMc_v1.py
Analysis of both variables and weights for SM starting point simulation, only reweighted where WCs are set to 5 and 10 and manual selection of reweighted simulation using eft_weights_oldv.py.
